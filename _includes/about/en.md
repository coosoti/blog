Hello, my name is [Osoti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osoti-charles-55558835), a telecommunications expert by formal training and a self-taught programmer. I consider myself a junior software engineer, but I fail to shake off the notion of being an imposter. Currently, I am interested in quite a few areas, including DevOps, robust and scalable back-end development, and other parts forming the basis of computer science.

I am currently training in [Software Engineering](https://www.alxafrica.com/software/) at [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com), specializing in back-end web development. I am also improving my problem-solving skills by regularly tackling problems by applying different algorithms using C, Python, and JavaScript programming languages.

#### Other Areas
* Bash Scripting
* ORM
* SQL and NoSQL Databases
* Web Infrastructure
